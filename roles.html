								Volleyball is a team sport that relies on a variety of specialized positions, each with its own unique responsibilities. The setter is the strategic leader, responsible for running the offense by delivering accurate sets to attackers. They must read the game quickly and make smart decisions to keep the opposing defense off balance. The middle blocker plays at the net in the center and focuses on quick attacks and blocking the opponent’s hitters. They need great timing and agility to react fast and close blocks effectively. The power hitter or outside hitter is a key offensive player who often receives the most sets. They also play a major role in serve receive and back-row defense, making them one of the most versatile positions. The tech, or opposite hitter, lines up on the right side and is usually the second-best attacker after the power. They help block the other team’s strongest hitters and can also be a backup setter. Finally, the libero is the defensive specialist, wearing a different jersey and playing only in the back row. Their main job is to dig, pass, and keep the ball alive, often setting the tone for the team’s defense. Together, these roles form a well-rounded and cohesive unit.
