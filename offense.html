								Attack in volleyball is the art of scoring points through aggressive and strategic plays, starting with the serve and followed by hitting. A strong serve is the first opportunity to pressure the opponent. Players may use float serves, topspin, or jump serves to disrupt passing formations. Consistent, tough serving can force poor passes and limit the opposing setter’s options. After serve receive, attacking begins with a well-executed set and a coordinated approach by the hitter. Hitters aim to strike the ball with power, speed, or finesse to get past the block and beat the defense. The power hitter often leads attacks from the left side, while the tech/opposite adds balance from the right. Middle hitters use quick, low sets to exploit gaps before the block is fully formed. Hitters must vary their shots—spikes, tips, roll shots, or line shots—to stay unpredictable. Smart attacking isn’t just about power; it’s about timing, placement, and court awareness. Back-row attacks also add dimension, letting players hit from behind the 10-foot line. An effective attack constantly shifts pressure onto the defense, forcing errors or creating opportunities to score cleanly through aggressive, strategic plays.
