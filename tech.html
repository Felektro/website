								The opposite hitter—sometimes called the “tech”—plays on the right side of the court and is a powerful weapon both offensively and defensively. As the name implies, they usually play opposite the setter in the rotation. This position allows them to be ready to attack on nearly every play, often against the opponent’s best blockers. The opposite hitter is expected to score efficiently and consistently, especially in high-pressure moments when the ball isn’t passed perfectly. Defensively, the tech takes on the challenge of blocking the opposing team’s outside hitters, who are typically strong attackers. A good opposite must have a powerful swing, a high volleyball IQ, and the ability to adapt quickly to different game situations. Since they don’t usually participate in serve receive, they can conserve energy for attacking and blocking. However, in some systems, techs are also called upon to set the ball if the primary setter makes the first contact. This adds an extra layer of responsibility and requires solid technical skills. The best opposite hitters are known for their clutch plays, court awareness, and ability to turn broken plays into points.
