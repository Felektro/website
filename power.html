								The power hitter, or outside hitter, is one of the most versatile and relied-upon players on a volleyball team. Positioned on the left side of the court, they are often the go-to option for attacking, especially when the team is out of system. Power hitters must possess a strong arm, consistent hitting technique, and the ability to adjust to imperfect sets. They frequently receive high balls, which require them to generate their own power and place the ball strategically. Outside hitters are also heavily involved in serve receive and back-row defense, making them all-around players. Because of their frequent involvement in both offense and defense, they need excellent endurance and mental toughness. They often carry a significant scoring load and must remain composed under pressure. Communication and leadership are also important traits for a power hitter, as they help anchor the team's rhythm and confidence. Whether delivering a high-powered spike down the line or digging a tough serve in the backcourt, the outside hitter plays a critical role in keeping the team balanced and competitive.
