								The libero is a defensive specialist, easily recognized by their contrasting jersey and unique rules. They are not allowed to attack the ball above the net height or serve (in some leagues), and they can’t rotate into the front row. Their main role is to receive serves and dig attacks, anchoring the team’s defense with consistent, controlled touches. The libero typically replaces the middle blockers in the back row, ensuring that a more skilled defender is always covering that position. Because of this, they must have quick reflexes, excellent reading skills, and flawless passing technique. A libero’s ability to control the first touch is critical for running an effective offense, as a good pass sets up the setter and, by extension, the hitters. Although they don’t score points directly, liberos are game-changers through their ability to keep plays alive and turn defense into offense. They often act as on-court leaders, providing energy, communication, and strategic input from the back row. While their role is less flashy, their contributions are invaluable to a well-functioning volleyball team.
