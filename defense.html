								Defense in volleyball is a combination of blocking at the net and digging in the backcourt, designed to neutralize the opponent’s attacks and turn defense into offense. Blocking is the first line of defense, performed by front-row players who jump to intercept or deflect the opponent’s hit. Timing, hand positioning, and reading the setter’s cues are critical to forming a solid block. Middle blockers often close blocks quickly by moving along the net to assist the pin blockers. A successful block can result in a direct point or a deflection that slows the ball down for the defense to recover.

								Behind the block, digging is all about anticipation, positioning, and reaction. Liberos and back-row players read hitters’ body language and approach angles to predict where the ball will go. A good dig doesn’t just keep the ball off the floor—it gives the team a playable ball to transition back into attack. Defensive specialists must have fast reflexes, strong footwork, and the ability to stay calm under pressure. While defense may not always get the glory, it creates momentum-shifting plays and gives teams second chances. Great defense frustrates opponents, keeps rallies alive, and builds the foundation for a strong counterattack.
