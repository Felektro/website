						<p>
							In volleyball, offense, defense, and setting are the three key components that define how a team performs during a rally. Offense revolves around executing attacks that break through or bypass the opponent's defense. It starts with a good pass and relies heavily on the setter, who decides which hitter to set based on positioning, timing, and strategy. The goal is to create a quick, deceptive play—often involving the power, middle, or tech hitter—to keep blockers guessing. Successful offenses use a mix of fast sets, back-row attacks, and strategic placement to disrupt the defense’s rhythm.
						</p>
						<p>
							Defense, on the other hand, focuses on reading the opponent’s attack and reacting quickly. It begins at the net with blocking, where the front-row players attempt to stop or redirect spikes. Behind them, liberos and back-row defenders position themselves to dig hard-driven balls or tip coverage. Effective defense is about anticipation, court coverage, and keeping the ball in play to transition back into offense.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the center of both systems is the setter. They act as the team’s playmaker, constantly assessing the defense, adjusting tempo, and delivering consistent, smart sets under pressure. A skilled setter elevates the entire team by balancing offensive options and maintaining flow in transition.
